# Class 7: Programming with JavaScript

## Chapter 1a

JavaScript allows developers to create series of programmatic instructions called scripts which can access and modify the content of HTML page, stipulate rules for a browser to follow while on that page, and react to events triggered by the browser or user. Examples of how these abilities can be applied are:

- Advanced presentation constructs (e.g. visual slideshows)
- Data input (e.g. a subscription form)
- Selective dynamic reloading of page elements (e.g. frames)
- Filtering data (e.g. through a user search)

The core feature of scripts is that they are programmatic. This means they are explicit, specific, thorough, and consistent in the nature of the instructions that they provide to a computer. Scripts must be written this way in order to be interpreted properly by a computer's operating system and CPU.

With that in mind, it is equally important for a software developer to have concrete goals for scripts they are writing before they start. This will help make their design clearer and less likely to cause errors due to ambiguity.

Expressions and operators are a core mechanism of all programming languages, not just JS.
