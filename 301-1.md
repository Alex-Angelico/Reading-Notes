# Read: 01 - SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

The first guideline of functional website design is that it is both responsive and adaptive. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change. With responsive design websites continually and fluidly change based on different factors, such as viewport width, while adaptive websites are built to a group of preset factors.

Responsive web design consists of three main components.

1. **Flexible Layouts**
The practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding. The formula for determining optimal proportions of a flexible layout is based around taking the target width of an element and dividing it by the width of it’s parent element. The result is the relative width of the target element.

> target ÷ context = result

Taking the flexible layout concept, and formula, and reapplying it to all parts of a grid will create a completely dynamic website, scaling to every viewport size. For even more control within a flexible layout, you can also leverage the min-width, max-width, min-height, and max-height properties.

The flexible layout approach alone isn’t enough. At times the width of a browser viewport may be so small that even scaling the the layout proportionally will create columns that are too small to effectively display content. Specifically, when the layout gets too small, or too large, text may become illegible and the layout may begin to break. In this event, media queries can be used to help build a better experience.

2. **Media Queries**
Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation for example. Being able to apply uniquely [targeted styles](https://css-tricks.com/css-media-queries/) opens up a world of opportunity and leverage to responsive web design.

There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. Generally speaking it is recommend to use the `@media` rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests. Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including `and`, `not`, and `only`.

#### Mobile First

One popular technique with using media queries is called mobile first. The mobile first approach includes using styles targeted at smaller viewports as the default styles for a website, then use media queries to add styles as the viewport grows.

The operating belief behind mobile first design is that a user on a mobile device, commonly using a smaller viewport, shouldn’t have to load the styles for a desktop computer only to have them over written with mobile styles later. Doing so is a waste of bandwidth. Bandwidth that is precious to any users looking for a snappy website.

The mobile first approach also advocates designing with the constraints of a mobile user in mind. Before too long, the majority of Internet consumption will be done on a mobile device. Plan for them accordingly and develop intrinsic mobile experiences.

Mobile devices generally do a pretty decent job of displaying websites these days. Sometimes they could use a little assistance though, particularly around identifying the viewport size, scale, and resolution of a website. For this, the `viewport` meta tag is available. Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively. Each value accepts either a positive integer or keyword. For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Using these keywords will inherit the device’s default height and width value. For the best results, and the best looking website, it is recommend that you use the device defaults by applying the device-height and device-width values.

To control how a website is scaled on a mobile device, and how users can continue to scale a website, use the minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, and user-scalable properties.

The initial-scale of a website should be set to 1 as this defines the ratio between the device height, while in a portrait orientation, and the viewport size. Should a device be in landscape mode this would be the ratio between the device width and the viewport size. Values for initial-scale should always be a positive integer between 0 and 10.

Letting the browser decide how to scale a website based off any viewport scale values usually does the trick. When more control is needed, specifically over the resolution of a device, the target-densitydpi value may be used. The target-densitydpi viewport accepts a handful of values including device-dpi, high-dpi, medium-dpi, low-dpi, or an actual DPI number.

Using the target-densitydpi viewport value is rare, but extremely helpful when pixel by pixel control is needed.

The viewport meta tag will accept individual values as well as multiple values, allowing multiple viewport properties to be set at once. Setting multiple values requires comma separating them within the content attribute value. One of the recommended viewport values is outlined below, using both the width and initial-scale properties.

3. **Flexible Media**
The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.

To get embedded media to be fully responsive, the embedded element needs to be absolutely positioned within a parent element. The parent element needs to have a width of 100% so that it may scale based on the width of the viewport. The parent element also needs to have a height of 0 to trigger the hasLayout mechanism within Internet Explorer.

## Floats

There are four valid values for the float property. Left and Right float elements those directions respectively. None (the default) ensures the element will not float and Inherit which will assume the float value from that elements parent element. Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

Float’s sister property is `clear`. An element that has the `clear` property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Clearing only the left or right float, while less commonly seen in the wild, definitely has its uses.

## Simple and Effective Grids

The vast majority of websites out there use a grid. They may not explicitly have a grid system in place, but if they have a “main content area” floated to the left a “sidebar” floated to the right, it’s a simple grid.

If a more complex layout presents itself, people often reach for a grid framework. They assume grids are these super difficult things best left to super CSS nerds. That idea is perpetuated by the fact that a lot of the grid systems they reach for _are_ very complicated.
