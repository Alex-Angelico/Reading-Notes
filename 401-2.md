# 2 - Testing and Modules

## Test Driven Development with Python

The general principal of code testing calls for the creation of unit tests, which are purpose-built code blocks that test the I/O and data manipulation processes within a program (that can be written at any time it is deemed necessary). TDD, places a higher priority on building these unit tests by putting thinking about and writing the tests first--ahead of coding the program itself. This test-centric approach to software development can make starting a project harder, as this mode of thinking is not as natural.

To make the process easier, it helps to think about the smallest tests that can be done against core funcitons, to start with. For example, whether or not a simple API call produces the correct output, given a fixed input. Further, to facilitate clear separation of concerns, testing infrastructure (i.e. directories and test files) should be apart from produciton code, while using nomenclature that mirrors that of production files.

It is also wise to follow the widely used convention for how tests are run, known as "Arrange, Act, and Assert":

1. *Arrange* - Organize the data needed to execute the targeted module of code.
2. *Act* - Execute the code being tested
3. *Assert* - Evaluate whether or not execution results match expectations.

By following this convention, it becomes easier to perpetuate a virtuous testing cycle of:

1. Testing to fail.
2. Writing features to trigger test success.
3. Refactoring to imrpove code structure.

## Recursion

Recursion is the process wherein a function call itself, either directly or indirectly (i.e. through an intermediate funciton). Recursive programs can be used to solve certain kinds of mathematical problems more easily than iterative programs.

### Recursive Programming vs Iterative Programming

#### Advantages

Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code. Some problems are inherently recursive like tree traversals, Tower of Hanoi, etc. For such problems, it is preferred to write recursive code. We can write such codes also iteratively with the help of a stack data structure. For example refer Inorder Tree Traversal without Recursion, Iterative Tower of Hanoi.

#### Disadvantages

Note that both recursive and iterative programs have the same problem-solving powers, i.e., every recursive program can be written iteratively and vice versa is also true. The recursive program has greater space requirements than iterative program as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. It also has greater time requirements because of function calls and returns overhead.

### Differences in Memory Allocation for Recursive Functions

When any function is called from main(), memory is allocated to it on the stack. When a recursive function calls itself, the memory for the called function is allocated on top of memory allocated to calling function, and unique copies of local variables are created for each function call. When the base case is reached, the function returns its value to the calling function, and memory is de-allocated.

If the base case is not reached or not defined, stack overflow may occur--specifically, this will happen if/when computer memory is exhausted.

### Recursion Base Cases

In a recursive function, the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems. An example follows:

```
int fact(int n)
{
    if (n < = 1) // base case
        return 1;
    else    
        return n*fact(n-1);    
}
```

In the above example, base case for n < = 1 is defined and larger value of number can be solved by converting to smaller one till base case is reached.
