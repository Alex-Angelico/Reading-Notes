  - `v` - paste a cell
  - `x` - cut a cell
  - `d` - to delete a cell (pressed twice)
  - `(Shift)-Z` - to undo or redo a cell
  - `Shift-Enter` - to run a cell
  - `y` - change cell format
  - `m` - change to markdown
  - `0` to reset a kernel (pressed twice)

## NumPy Arrays

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. It is very powerful and flexible.

### Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix; in fact, it’s just a different way of thinking about a list of lists. A matrix has rows and columns. By specifying a row number and a column number, it is possible to extract an element from a matrix. In a NumPy array, the number of dimensions is called the rank, and each dimension is called an axis. So the rows are the first axis, and the columns are the second axis.

#### Creating A NumPy Array

A NumPy array is created by using the `numpy.array()` function. If the function is passed a list of lists as an argument, it will automatically parse out a NumPy array with the corresponding number of rows and columns as the argument contains.

However, a limitation of NumPy is that all elements in the array have to be of the same type. Thus, if one tried to use `numpy.array()` to convert a list of lists into a legible table, where the first list in the argument contains string elements for use as column labels, all of the data lists after that would have their elements converted to string data as well. This would cause problems if the table's data is supposed to be processed via further mathematical operations.

##### Alternative Methods for Creating NumPy Arrays with Numeric Elements

- `numpy.zeros(x,y)` - Makes an array with x/y dimensions where every element is an integer 0.
- `numpy.ones(x,y)` - Makes an array with x/y dimensions where every element is an integer 1.
- `numpy.random.rand(x,y)` - Makes an array with x/y dimensions where every element is an random floating point number.
- `np.genfromtxt("[file_name]", delimiter="[character]", skip_header=1)` - Reads data from a file directly into an array.

##### Indexing, Slicing, and Assignment

- `array[x,y]` - Targets a specific element in an array according to its 2-dimensional index of row and column values.
- `array[x:x,y:y]` - Slices a range of elements in an array along a row, column, or both.
- `array[x,y] = z` - Assigns a new value to a target element.

_Note: 1-Dimensional NumPy Arrays are the product of slicing a conventional 2-dimensional Numpy array along either a row or column value--but not both!_

### N-Dimensional NumPy Arrays

From time to time, the need may arise to create and manipulate arrays of data that have 3 dimensions or more. For example, a simplified database of quarterly earnings for a business would be composed of a 2-dimensional array for each year (split into 4 quarterly lists with 3 elements for each month), and a 3-dimensional array accounting for 2 (or more) years.

Using the method `array.shape()` on this array would return dimensions of (2, 4, 3): 2 for the number of years, 4 for the number of rows per year, and 3 for the number of columns per year.

To slice out the first-quarter earnings for both years, the following instruction would be used: `array[:,0,:]. In plain English, this would return all values from the first row of each 2-dimensional array.

#### Broadcasting

It is only possible to execute elementwise comparison operations between arrays if the two arrays have the exact same dimensions. For all other cases, NumPy facilitates a process called broadcasting to match corresponding elements between arrays. The process is outlined below.

1. The last dimension of each array is compared.

  - If the dimension lengths are equal, or one of the dimensions is of length 1, proceed.
  - If the dimension lengths aren’t equal, and none of the dimensions have length 1, return an error.

2. Continue checking dimensions until the shortest array is out of dimensions.

### NumPy Data Types

Data types used by NumPy arrays correspond closely to normal Python data types: float64, int32, string, and object. The numbers on the end of float and int represent the amount of memory each type uses in bits.

#### Array Methods for Viewing and Manipulating Data Types

- `array.dtype()` - Returns the data type of an array.
- `numpy.ndarray.astype(type)` - Converts array data to a different type according to the type argument.

### NumPy Array Methods

In addition to the common mathematical operations, NumPy also offers several methods that can be use for more complex calculations on arrays. Some common ones are listed below:

- `numpy.ndarray.sum()` - Finds the sum of all values in an array.
- `numpy.ndarray.mean()` - Finds the mean of an array.
- `numpy.ndarray.std()` - Finds the standard deviation of an array.
- `numpy.ndarray.min()` - Finds the minimum value in an array.
- `numpy.ndarray.max()` - Finds the maximum value in an array.

A full list with explanations can be found [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html#array-methods).

### NumPy Array Comparisons

NumPy makes it possible to test to see if elements match certain values using conventional comparison operators (<, >, >=, <=, and ==), which return boolean statements. This technique can be applied to entire rows or columns to extract sets of data that meet certain conditions.

### Reshaping NumPy Arrays

This often can make it easier to access array elements. The simplest reshaping is to flip the axes, so rows become columns, and vice versa. However, arrays can also be transformed into a one-dimensional representation, or otherwise reshaped to dimensions specified by a programmer. 

#### Array Reshaping Methods

- `numpy.transpose()` - Flips an array's x and y axes.
- `numpy.ravel()` - Flattens an array into a longer 1-dimensional sequence of values.
- `numpy.reshape(x,y)` - Reshapes an array using arguments for x and y axes.

#### Combining NumPy Arrays

With NumPy, it’s very common to combine multiple arrays into a single unified array. Methods for achieving this are listed below:

- `np.vstack()` - Vertically stacks multiple arrays.
- `numpy.hstack()` - Horizontally stacks multiple arrays.
- `numpy.concatenate(axis=z)` - A general purpose version of hstack and vstack where the axis keyword argument to concatenate along is  specified. Concatenating along the first axis is similar to vstack, and concatenating along the second axis is similar to hstack.
