## Introduction to Jupyter Lab

### Text, Code Consoles, Terminals

- Syntax highlighting
- Configurable indentation
- Create a code console from a dropdown menu
- Provides full support for system shells on Windows through PowerShell (including VIM and emacs)

- VEGA files can be rendered standalone or as cell outputs.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyer Notebooks are the programmer's equivalent of spreadsheets or slide presentations: they offer a graphically rich, easy way to work with code.

- Can be run in either command or edit mode, depending on purpose.

- Command mode includes many useful shortcuts.
  - `a` - add a cell above
  - `b` - add a cell below

  - `Shift-Enter` - to run a cell
  - `y` - change cell format
  - `m` - change to markdown
  - `0` to reset a kernel (pressed twice)
