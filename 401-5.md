# 5 - Linked Lists

A linked list is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a linked list is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two principal types of linked list:

1. **Singly:** Singly linked lists are the simplest type of linked list, based solely on the fact that they only go in one direction. There is a single track that we can traverse the list in; we start at the head node, and traverse from the root until the last node, which will end at an empty null value.

2. **Doubly:** Doubly linked lists contain two references within each node: a reference to the next node, as well as the previous node. This can be helpful if we wanted to be able to traverse our data structure not just in a single track or direction, but also backwards, too.

Further, there is a special subtype called **Circular**. A circular linked list doesn’t end with a node pointing to a null value. Instead, it has a node that acts as the tail of the list (rather than the conventional head node), and the node after the tail node is the beginning of the list. This organization structure makes it easy to add something to the end of the list, because one can begin traversing it at the tail node, as the first element and last element point to one another. Both singly linked lists and a doubly linked lists can be circular linked lists.

## Key Terms

- *Linked List* - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
- *Singly* - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
- *Doubly* - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
- *Node* - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
- *Next* - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
- *Head* - The Head is a reference type of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
- *Current* - The Current reference is a reference type of type Node that is currently being looked at. This node is traditionally used when traversing through a full linked list. When traversing, it is typical to reset the current to the head to guarantee starting from the beginning of the linked list.

## Distinguishing Linked Lists from Arrays/Lists

The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use computer memory.

When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. An array with 7 letters would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array. Moreover, that memory must be allocated in one contiguous block. Conversely, Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout a system.

The corollary of this fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures. A static data structure needs all of its resources to be allocated when the structure is created; this means that even if the structure was to grow or shrink in size and elements were to be added or removed, it still always needs a given size and amount of memory. If more elements needed to be added to a static data structure and it didn’t have enough memory, it would be necessary to copy the data of that array, for example, and recreate it with more memory allocated.

On the other hand, a dynamic data structure can shrink and grow in memory. It doesn’t need a set amount of memory to be allocated in order to exist, and its size and shape can change, and the amount of memory it needs can change as well.

The feature of linked lists that enables this different behavior is the Node. A single Node doesn’t know how long the linked list is, and it may not necessarily even know where it starts, or where it ends. All a Node is concerned with is the data it contains, and which Node its pointer references to — the next node in the list. Because a single node has the address, or reference, to the next node, successive nodes don’t need to occupy adjacent memory blocks, the way that the elements have to in an array.

This is why linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically during a program’s execution. Adding or removing a node with a linked list becomes as simple as rearranging some pointers, rather than copying over the elements of an array.

## Traversal

Unlike normal lists, `foreach` or `for` loops cannot be used to traverse linked lists. Instead, programmers depend on the Next value in each node to guide move to where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead to where the next node is and facilitate extraction of its data appropriately.

The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a `while` loop. This allows one to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. In the event of accidental traversal to a node that is null, a NullReferenceException gets thrown and the executing program will crash.

When traversing through a linked list, the Current node is the most helpful. Current describes exactly where in the linked list a pointer currently is, and allows forward traversal until the end.

## Big O for Linked Lists

The two types of Big O equations to remember for linked lists are O(1) and O(N).
