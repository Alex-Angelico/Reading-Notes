# 30 - [Hash Tables](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/)

Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects using special identifying keys. In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the element in O(1) time. Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.

## Key Terms

- **Hash** - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
- **Buckets** - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
- **Collisions** - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

## Implementation

Hashing is implemented in two steps:

1. An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.
2. The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

    ```
    hash = hashfunc(key)
    index = hash % array_size
    ```

In this method, the hash is independent of the array size and it is then reduced to an index (a number between 0 and array_size − 1) by using the modulo operator (%).

## Hash Creation

A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

In the `hashfunc` referenced above, the key is turned into a numeric number hash value using arithmetic logic of some kind. A possibile algorithm is described below:

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values of the key together.
2. Take the resultant sum or product and multiply it by a prime number such as 599.

Generally speaking, to achieve a good hashing mechanism, It is important to have a good hash function with the following basic requirements:

- **Easy to compute**: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
- **Uniform distribution**: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.
- **Less collisions**: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.

*Note: Irrespective of how good a hash function is, collisions are bound to occur. Therefore, to maintain the performance of a hash table, it is important to manage collisions through various collision resolution techniques.*

## Collisions

A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. As mentioned earlier, a “perfect hash” will never have any collisions. To put this into perspective, the worst possible hash is one that hashes every single key to the same exact index of an array. The more keys you have hashed to a specific index, the more key/value pair combos you can potentially have.

What would happen if two different keys resolved to be the same index of the array? This is called a collision. The hash map needs to be able to handle two keys resolving to the same index.

If two keys ever ultimately resolved to the same index, then two calls to .Add(key, val) with different keys would overwrite each other.

Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one! Now if two keys resolve to the same index in the array then their key/value pairs can be stored as a node in a linked list. Each index in the array is called a “bucket” because it can store multiple key/value pairs.

Since different keys can lead to the same bucket it’s important to store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, not just the value. The key must be stored with the value! If only values were stored in buckets then it would be impossible to determine which value to return when a key led you to a bucket.

## Bucket Sizes

Hash Maps can have any number of buckets. If a hash map has only a few buckets it will be densely full and have many collisions. If a hash map has more buckets it will be more sparsely populated, there will be less collisions, but there may be a lot of extra empty space.

It’s possible to compute the “load factor” of a hash table. The load factor tells us something about how full the hash table is. A hash table can start with only a few buckets, calculate it’s own load factor, recognize when it gets too full and automatically grow and add more buckets to itself to accommodate more data.

Recognize: calculating load factors and choosing the optimal number of buckets, and determining the best hash functions is not within the scope of this class. This class intends to introduce you to what a hash table is, how it’s implemented, what hash codes are, how to handle collisions and how to reason generally about what it means for a hash table to be more empty or more full. This class does not intend to calculate theoretical optimal performance limits for how to best balance a Hash Table.

Here’s what the same information looks like in two different hash tables. The first hash table only has 7 buckets. The second has 100 buckets. Notice that even though the second hash table has 100 buckets there are still some collisions. Collisions are ok! We just don’t want every key to hash to the exact same index. That would be literally the worst!

## Potential Applications of Hash Tables

- **Associative arrays**: Hash tables are commonly used to implement many types of in-memory tables. They are used to implement associative arrays (arrays whose indices are arbitrary strings or other complicated objects).
- **Database indexing**: Hash tables may also be used as disk-based data structures and database indices (such as in dbm).
- **Caches**: Hash tables can be used to implement caches i.e. auxiliary data tables that are used to speed up the access to data, which is primarily stored in slower media.
- **Object representation**: Several dynamic languages, such as Perl, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby use hash tables to implement objects.
- Hash Functions are used in various algorithms to make their computing faster
