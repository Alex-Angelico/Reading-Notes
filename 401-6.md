## Big O Notation

_Note: Big O is vital for interviews. Don't be lazy about becoming familiar with it!_

Defining Big O: How runtime scales with respect to input variables.

Although N is the standard notation for expressing Big O, N is just a placeholder variable that can be switched for anything.

### The 4 Important Rules

- Distinct steps should be combined to form a single Big O expression. For example: _O(a) + O(b) = O(a+b)_
- Constants should be dropped to simplify Big O, because Big O is concerned with approximating magnitude. For example: _O(2N) = O(N)_
- If a given Big O calculation is reliant on multiple inputs, it will require multiple variables to express. For example: _O(N<sup>2</sup>) = O(a*b)_
- Remove non-dominant terms from a Big O expression. For example: _O(N+N<sup>2</sup>) = O(N<sup>2</sup>)_

## Using Python's Random Module

The Random module contains some very useful functions.

- `randint`: Accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number. Generate integers between 1,5. The first value should be less than the second. Format: `random.randint(0, 5)`
- `choice`: Generate a random value from the sequence sequence. The choice function can often be used for choosing a random element from a list. Format: `random.choice(myList)`
- `shuffle`: The shuffle function moves the elements of a list in place, producing a new random order. Format: ```
from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)```
- `randrange`: Generate a randomly selected element from a designated range. Format: ```
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)```

## Risk Analysis in Software Testing

The probability of any unwanted incident is defined as Risk. In Software Testing, risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test. After that, the process of assigning the level of risk is done. The categorization of the risks takes place, hence, the impact of the risk is calculated.

In any software, using risk analysis at the beginning of a project highlights the potential problem areas. After knowing about the risk areas, it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks. When a test plan has been created, risks involved in testing the product are to be taken into consideration along with the possibility of the damage they may cause to your software along with solutions.

### Risk Identification

There are different sets of risks included in the risk identification process.

- **Business:** External to a project, originating from the company or customers.
- **Testing:** A problem of insufficient familiarity with software testing tools being used.
- **Premature Release:** Caused by releasing unsatisfactory or untested software.
- **Software:** Inherent to the software development process overall.

### Risk Assessment Perspeectives

There are three perspectives of Risk Assessment.

- **Effect:** Identifying a condition, event or action and trying to determine its impact.
**Cause:** Looking at the problem first and attempting reach to the point that could be the most probable reason for failure.
**Likelihood:** Determining the probability that a requirement wonâ€™t be satisfied.

### Performing Risk Analysis

1. Searching for risks.
2. Analyzing the impact of each individual risk.
3. Establishing measurementss for identified risks.
