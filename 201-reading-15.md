# Reading 15: What Google Learned About Teams

_Tip: The most productive employees build larger networks by rotating dining companions._

Google's top executives long believed that building the best teams meant combining the best people. They embraced other bits of conventional wisdom as well, like "It's better to put introverts together," said Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google's People Analytics division, or "Teams are more effective when everyone is friends away from work." But, Dubey went on, "it turned out no one had really studied which of those were true."

No matter how researchers arranged the data, though, it was almost impossible to find patterns — or any evidence that the composition of a team made any difference. "We looked at 180 teams from all over the company," Dubey said. "We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The 'who' part of the equation didn't seem to matter."

Some groups that were ranked among Google's most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work. Others were made up of people who were basically strangers away from the conference room. Some groups sought strong managers. Others preferred a less hierarchical structure. Most confounding of all, two teams might have nearly identical makeups, with overlapping memberships, but radically different levels of effectiveness. "At Google, we're good at finding patterns," Dubey said. "There weren't strong patterns here."

After looking at over a hundred groups for more than a year, Project Aristotle researchers concluded that understanding and influencing group norms were the keys to improving Google's teams.

In 2008, a group of psychologists attempted to find similar answers with a study of 699 people, divided into small groups to work as teams on a series of assignments.

What interested the researchers most, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others. Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything. The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the "good" teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group's collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.

What was confusing was that not all the good teams appeared to behave in the same ways. "Some teams had a bunch of smart people who figured out how to break up work evenly," said Anita Woolley, the study's lead author. "Other groups had pretty average members, but they came up with ways to take advantage of everyone's relative strengths. Some groups had one strong leader. Others were more fluid, and everyone took a leadership role."

As the researchers studied the groups, however, they noticed two behaviors that all the good teams generally shared. First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking." On some teams, everyone spoke during each task; on others, leadership shifted among teammates from assignment to assignment. But in each case, by the end of the day, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. "As long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well," Woolley said. "But if only one person or a small group spoke all the time, the collective intelligence declined."

Second, the good teams all had high "average social sensitivity" — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues. One of the easiest ways to gauge social sensitivity is to show someone photos of people's eyes and ask him or her to describe what the people are thinking or feeling — an exam known as the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. People on the more successful teams in Woolley's experiment scored above average on the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test. They seemed to know when someone was feeling upset or left out. People on the ineffective teams, in contrast, scored below average. They seemed, as a group, to have less sensitivity toward their colleagues.

oOn the more successful teams, people may speak over one another, go on tangents and socialize instead of remaining focused on the agenda. The team may seem inefficient to a casual observer. But all the team members speak as much as they need to. They are sensitive to one another's moods and share personal stories and emotions. While Team B might not contain as many individual stars, the sum will be greater than its parts.

Within psychology, researchers sometimes colloquially refer to traits like "conversational turn-taking" and "average social sensitivity" as aspects of what's known as psychological safety — a group culture that the Harvard Business School professor Amy Edmondson defines as a "shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking." Psychological safety is "a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up," Edmondson wrote in a study published in 1999. "It describes a team climate characterized by interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being themselves."

When Google researchers encountered the concept of psychological safety in academic papers, it was as if everything suddenly fell into place. For Project Aristotle, research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well — like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google's data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.

However, establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement. You can tell people to take turns during a conversation and to listen to one another more. You can instruct employees to be sensitive to how their colleagues feel and to notice when someone seems upset. But the kinds of people who work at Google are often the ones who became software engineers because they wanted to avoid talking about feelings in the first place.

The major discovery was that psychological safety and emotional conversations are related. The behaviors that create psychological safety — conversational turn-taking and empathy — are part of the same unwritten rules we often turn to, as individuals, when we need to establish a bond. And those human bonds matter as much at work as anywhere else. In fact, they sometimes matter more.

What Project Aristotle has taught people within Google is that no one wants to put on a "work face" when they get to the office. No one wants to leave part of their personality and inner life at home. But to be fully present at work, to feel "psychologically safe," we must know that we can be free enough, sometimes, to share the things that scare us without fear of recriminations. We must be able to talk about what is messy or sad, to have hard conversations with colleagues who are driving us crazy. We can't be focused just on efficiency. Rather, when we start the morning by collaborating with a team of engineers and then send emails to our marketing colleagues and then jump on a conference call, we want to know that those people really hear us. We want to know that work is more than just labor.

"Just having data that proves to people that these things are worth paying attention to sometimes is the most important step in getting them to actually pay attention," Julia Rozovsky, lead research on Project Aristotle says. "Don't underestimate the power of giving people a common platform and operating language."

Project Aristotle is a reminder that when companies try to optimize everything, it's sometimes easy to forget that success is often built on experiences — like emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can't really be optimized. Rozovsky herself was reminded of this midway through her work with the Project Aristotle team. "We were in a meeting where I made a mistake," Rozovsky told me. She sent out a note afterward explaining how she was going to remedy the problem. "I got an email back from a team member that said, 'Ouch,' " she recalled. "It was like a punch to the gut. I was already upset about making this mistake, and this note totally played on my insecurities."

If this had happened earlier in Rozovsky's life — if it had occurred while she was at Yale, for instance, in her study group — she probably wouldn't have known how to deal with those feelings. The email wasn't a big enough affront to justify a response. But all the same, it really bothered her. It was something she felt she needed to address. And thanks to Project Aristotle, she now had a vocabulary for explaining to herself what she was feeling and why it was important. She had graphs and charts telling her that she shouldn't just let it go. And so she typed a quick response: "Nothing like a good 'Ouch!' to destroy psych safety in the morning." Her teammate replied: "Just testing your resilience."

"That could have been the wrong thing to say to someone else, but he knew it was exactly what I needed to hear," Rozovsky said. "With one 30-second interaction, we defused the tension." She wanted to be listened to. She wanted her teammate to be sensitive to what she was feeling. "And I had research telling me that it was O.K. to follow my gut," she said. "So that's what I did. The data helped me feel safe enough to do what I thought was right."
