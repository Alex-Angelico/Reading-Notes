# 4 - Classes & Objects, Recursion, and Pytest Fixtures & Coverage

## Classes & Objects

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes, which are essentially a template used to create objects. Classes are used to create multiple objects that have the same set of defined variables and functions. Each object simply contains independent copies of the variables and funcitons inherited from the class.

To access a variable of an object, dot notation is used (e.g. object.variable). The same is true for accessing an object's functions (e.g. object.function()).

## Thinking Recursively

A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

The power of recursion is to rapidly break large problems down into smaller pieces which can be solved quickly. Put another way: "If the current problem represents a simple case, solve it. If not, divide it into subproblems and apply the same strategy to them."

This strategy can be applied, for instance, to the problem Santa Claus has when it comes to delievering presents to every house.

```
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

# Each function call represents an elf doing his work 
def deliver_presents_recursively(houses):
    # Worker elf doing his work
    if len(houses) == 1:
        house = houses[0]
        print("Delivering presents to", house)

    # Manager elf doing his work
    else:
        mid = len(houses) // 2
        first_half = houses[:mid]
        second_half = houses[mid:]

        # Divides his work among two elves
        deliver_presents_recursively(first_half)
        deliver_presents_recursively(second_half)
```

The fundamental recursive principle on display here is that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

To demonstrate how this structure works, following is the work pattern of a recursive function for calculating n!:

1. Decompose the original problem into simpler instances of the same problem. This is the recursive case:

```
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1
n! = n x (n−1)!
```

2. As the large problem is broken down into successively less complex ones, those subproblems must eventually become so simple that they can be solved without further subdivision. This is the base case:

```
n! = n x (n−1)! 
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2)!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3)!
⋅
⋅
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2!
n! = n x (n−1) x (n−2) x (n−3) ⋅⋅⋅⋅ x 3 x 2 x 1!
```

Here, 1! is the base case. It equals 1.

This is how the same function looks when implemented in Python:

```
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```

This can be further visualized by way of the function's call stack. Behind the scenes, each recursive call adds a stack frame (containing its execution context) to the call stack until the base case is reached. Then, the stack begins to unwind as each call returns its results.

### Maintaining State During Recursion

When a recursive function is executed, each recursive call has its own execution context. Hence, in order to maintain state during recursion, it is necessary to do one of two things.

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context
- Keep the state in global scope

For instance, to calculate 1 + 2 + 3 ⋅⋅⋅⋅ + 10 using recursion, the state that must be maintained is: (current number being added, current accumulated sum). Below are two example Python implemenations.

#### Threading Through Iterative Calls

```
def sum_recursive(current_number, accumulated_sum):
    # Base case
    # Return the final state
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum

    # Recursive case
    # Thread the state through the recursive call
    else:
        return sum_recursive(current_number + 1, accumulated_sum + current_number)
```

#### Global Variable Preservation

```
# Global mutable state
current_number = 1
accumulated_sum = 0


def sum_recursive():
    global current_number
    global accumulated_sum
    # Base case
    if current_number == 11:
        return accumulated_sum
    # Recursive case
    else:
        accumulated_sum = accumulated_sum + current_number
        current_number = current_number + 1
        return sum_recursive()
```

In both cases, `sum_recursive(1,0)` will give an output of 55.

### Recursive Data Structures in Python

A data structure is recursive if it can be deﬁned in terms of a smaller version of itself. A list is an example of a recursive data structure. Other examples include set, tree, dictionary, etc.

Recursive data structures and recursive functions go together like bread and butter. The recursive function’s structure can often be modeled after the definition of the recursive data structure it takes as an input.

### Naive Recursion is Naive

The Fibonacci numbers were originally deﬁned by the Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the thirteenth century to model the growth of rabbit populations. Fibonacci surmised that the number of pairs of rabbits born in a given year is equal to the number of pairs of rabbits born in each of the two previous years, starting from one pair of rabbits in the ﬁrst year.

To count the number of rabbits born in the nth year, he deﬁned the recurrence relation F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>. The base cases are F<sub>0</sub> = 0 and F<sub>1</sub> = 1.

Example recursive Fibonacci funciton:

```
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)

fibonacci_recursive(5)
>>> Calculating F(5), Calculating F(4), Calculating F(3), Calculating F(2), Calculating F(1), 
>>> Calculating F(0), Calculating F(1), Calculating F(2), Calculating F(1), Calculating F(0), 
>>> Calculating F(3), Calculating F(2), Calculating F(1), Calculating F(0), Calculating F(1),
```

Naively following the recursive deﬁnition of the nth Fibonacci number was rather inefficient. As can be seen from the output above, it results in unnecessarily recomputing values. But fibonacci_recursive can be improved by caching the results of each Fibonacci computation F<sub>k</sub>:

```
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    print("Calculating F", "(", n, ")", sep="", end=", ")

    # Base case
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2)
```

lru_cache is a decorator that caches the results. Thus,recomputation is avoided by explicitly checking for the value before trying to compute it. One thing to keep in mind about lru_cache is that since it uses a dictionary to cache results, the positional and keyword arguments (which serve as keys in that dictionary) to the function must be hashable.

### Useful Pythonic Tips

Python doesn’t have support for tail-call elimination. As a result,a stack overflow can be caused if a funciton end up using more stack frames than the default call stack depth. This limitation should be kept in mind for programs that requires deep recursion.

Python’s mutable data structures don’t support structural sharing, so treating them like immutable data structures will negatively affect space and GC (garbage collection) efficiency because it means unnecessarily copying a lot of mutable objects.

## Python Testing with pytest: Fixtures and Coverage

### Fixtures

When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".

But in other cases, things are a bit more complex. You'll want to have some objects available to all of your tests. Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world, and they take a variety of different forms.

In pytest, you define fixtures using a combination of the pytest.fixture decorator, along with a function definition. For example, say you have a file that returns a list of lines from a file, in which each line is reversed:

```
def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
```

Note that in order to avoid the newline character from being placed at the start of the line, you remove it from the string before reversing and then add a '\n' in each returned string. Also note that although it probably would be a good idea to use a generator expression rather than a list comprehension, I'm trying to keep things relatively simple here.

If you're going to test this function, you'll need to pass it a file-like object. In my last article, I showed how you could use a StringIO object for such a thing, and that remains the case. But rather than defining global variables in your test file, you can create a fixture that'll provide your test with the appropriate object at the right time.

Here's how that looks in pytest:

```
@pytest.fixture
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```

On the face of it, this looks like a simple function—one that returns the value you'll want to use later. And in many ways, it's similar to what you'd get if you were to define a global variable by the name of "simple_file".

At the same time, fixtures are used differently from global variables. For example, let's say you want to include this fixture in one of your tests. You then can mention it in the test's parameter list. Then, inside the test, you can access the fixture by name. For example:

```
def test_reverse_lines(simple_file):
   assert reverse_lines(simple_file) == ['cba\n', 'fed\n', 'ihg\n', 'lkj\n']
```

But it gets even better. Your fixture might act like data, in that you don't invoke it with parentheses. But it's actually a function under the hood, which means it executes every time you invoke a test using that fixture. This means that the fixture, in contrast with regular-old data, can make calculations and decisions.

You also can decide how often a fixture is run. For example, as it's written now, this fixture will run once per test that mentions it. That's great in this case, when you want to compare with a list or file-like structure. But what if you want to set up an object and then use it multiple times without creating it again? You can do that by setting the fixture's "scope". For example, if you set the scope of the fixture to be "module", it'll be available throughout your tests but will execute only a single time. You can do this by passing the scope parameter to the @pytest.fixture decorator:

```
@pytest.fixture(scope='module')
def simple_file():
   return StringIO('\n'.join(['abc', 'def', 'ghi', 'jkl']))
```

I should note that giving this particular fixture "module" scope is a bad idea, since the second test will end up having a StringIO whose location pointer (checked with file.tell) is already at the end.

These fixtures work quite differently from the traditional setup/teardown system that many other test systems use. However, the pytest people definitely have convinced me that this is a better way.

But wait—perhaps you can see where the "setup" functionality exists in these fixtures. And, where's the "teardown" functionality? The answer is both simple and elegant. If your fixture uses "yield" instead of "return", pytest understands that the post-yield code is for tearing down objects and connections. And yes, if your fixture has "module" scope, pytest will wait until all of the functions in the scope have finished executing before tearing it down.

### Coverage

This is all great, but if you've ever done any testing, you know there's always the question of how thoroughly you have tested your code. After all, let's say you've written five functions, and that you've written tests for all of them. Can you be sure you've actually tested all of the possible paths through those functions?

For example, let's assume you have a very strange function, only_odd_mul, which multiplies only odd numbers:

```
def only_odd_mul(x, y):
   if x%2 and y%2:
       return x * y
   else:
       raise NoEvenNumbersHereException(f'{x} and/or {y} not odd')
```

Here's a test you can run on it:

```
def test_odd_numbers():
   assert only_odd_mul(3, 5) == 15
```

Sure enough, the test passed. It works great! The software is terrific!

Oh, but wait—as you've probably noticed, that wasn't a very good job of testing it. There are ways in which the function could give a totally different result (for example, raise an exception) that the test didn't check.

Perhaps it's easy to see it in this example, but when software gets larger and more complex, it's not going to be so easy to eyeball it. That where you want to have "code coverage", checking that your tests have run all of the code.

Now, 100% code coverage doesn't mean that your code is perfect or that it lacks bugs. But it does give you a greater degree of confidence in the code and the fact that it has been run at least once.

So, how can you include code coverage with pytest? It turns out that there's a package called pytest-cov on PyPI that you can download and install. Once that's done, you can invoke pytest with the --cov option. If you don't say anything more than that, you'll get a coverage report for every part of the Python library that your program used, so I strongly suggest you provide an argument to --cov, specifying which program(s) you want to test. And, you should indicate the directory into which the report should be written. So in this case, you would say:

```
pytest --cov=mymul .
```

Once you've done this, you'll need to turn the coverage report into something human-readable. I suggest using HTML, although other output formats are available:

```
coverage html
```

This creates a directory called htmlcov. Open the index.html file in this directory using your browser, and you'll get a web-based report showing (in red) where your program still lacks coverage. Sure enough, in this case, it showed that the even-number path wasn't covered. Let's add a test to do this:

```
def test_even_numbers():
   with pytest.raises(NoEvenNumbersHereException):
       only_odd_mul(2,4)
```

And as expected, coverage has now gone up to 100%! That's definitely something to appreciate and celebrate, but it doesn't mean you've reached optimal testing. You can and should cover different mixtures of arguments and what will happen when you pass them.
