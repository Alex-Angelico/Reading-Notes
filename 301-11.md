# Read: 11 - EJS

EJS is a powerful capability of the Express package in node.js which allows for variables to be injected to HTML via a server using the WRRC cycle. The means by which this is done is conceptually similar to how Mustache templating is used to populate HTML.

1. A server is configured to use the EJS package, which in turn can be applied to whatever routing functions a programmer desires.
2. Routing functions are selectively populated with an encapsulated `response.render()` function, which takes an HTML file path as its first parameter, followed by an obbject containing local variables (the third is an optional callback function).
3. Signalling notation is applied inline to relevant HTML elements, and within that notation is contained the local variable names or property keys connected to the object parameter in the routing function.
4. The values are then passed to the corresponding annotated variables in HTML, whether as text or attributes.

Below is the generic form of how a views directory--which contains EJS-connected HTML pages--is established in server.js.

```
var express = require('express');
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
var cors = require('cors');
var path = require('path');

var app = express();

app.use(bodyParser());
app.use(cors());

app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'));
app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
```
