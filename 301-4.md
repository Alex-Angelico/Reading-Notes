## Using Grid

[Master Reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

Contains instructions for:

- `display`: Defines the element as a grid container and establishes a new grid formatting context for its contents.
- `grid-column`: Determines a grid item’s location within the grid by referring to specific grid lines. grid-column-start/grid-row-start is the line where the item begins, and grid-column-end/grid-row-end is the line where the item ends.
- `grid-template`: Defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values. The values represent the track size, and the space between them represents the grid line.
- `grid-column`/`grid-row`: Shorthand for grid-column-start + grid-column-end, and grid-row-start + grid-row-end, respectively.
- `grid-area`: Gives an item a name so that it can be referenced by a template created with the grid-template-areas property. Alternatively, this property can be used as an even shorter shorthand for grid-row-start + grid-column-start + grid-row-end + grid-column-end.
- `grid-template-areas`: Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property. Repeating the name of a grid area causes the content to span those cells. A period signifies an empty cell. The syntax itself provides a visualization of the structure of the grid.
- `justify-self`: Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-self which aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to a grid item inside a single cell.
- `grid-template`: A shorthand for setting grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, and grid-template-areas in a single declaration.
- `align-self`: Aligns a grid item inside a cell along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-self which aligns along the inline (row) axis). This value applies to the content inside a single grid item.
- `place-self`: place-self sets both the align-self and justify-self properties in a single declaration.
- `gap`: A shorthand for row-gap and column-gap
- `justify-items`: Aligns grid items along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-items which aligns along the block (column) axis). This value applies to all grid items inside the container.
- `place-items`: place-items sets both the align-items and justify-items properties in a single declaration.
- `justify-content`: Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px. In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the inline (row) axis (as opposed to align-content which aligns the grid along the block (column) axis).
- `align-content`: Sometimes the total size of your grid might be less than the size of its grid container. This could happen if all of your grid items are sized with non-flexible units like px. In this case you can set the alignment of the grid within the grid container. This property aligns the grid along the block (column) axis (as opposed to justify-content which aligns the grid along the inline (row) axis).
- `place-content`: place-content sets both the align-content and justify-content properties in a single declaration.
- `grid-auto`: Specifies the size of any auto-generated grid tracks (aka implicit grid tracks). Implicit tracks get created when there are more grid items than cells in the grid or when a grid item is placed outside of the explicit grid.
- `grid-auto-flow`: If you have grid items that you don’t explicitly place on the grid, the auto-placement algorithm kicks in to automatically place the items. This property controls how the auto-placement algorithm works.
- `grid`: A shorthand for setting all of the following properties in a single declaration: grid-template-rows, grid-template-columns, grid-template-areas, grid-auto-rows, grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow (Note: You can only specify the explicit or the implicit grid properties in a single grid declaration).

### Special Functions and Keywords for Grid

- When sizing rows and columns, you can use all the lengths you are used to, like px, rem, %, etc, but you also have keywords like min-content, max-content, auto, and perhaps the most useful, fractional units. `grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 2fr min-content`.
- You also have access to a function which can help set boundaries for otherwise flexible units. For example to set a column to be 1fr, but shrink no further than 200px: `grid-template-columns: 1fr minmax(200px, 1fr)`.
- There is repeat() function, which saves some typing, like making 10 columns: grid-template-columns: `repeat(10, 1fr)`.
- Combining all of these things can be extremely powerful, like `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr))`.
