# Read: 08 - SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language - possibly the most apt name for a programmatic computing language ever devised. It formalizes the practice of soliciting information from databases of any scale using a large number of rules that vary in power in complexity. Even the basics can seem confusing at first, but a little practice goes a long way to enabling a programmer to undertake things as complex as creating and manipulating tables - and even creating realtionships between them.

SQL comes in many different implementations developed by a variety of companies, with some differences in capabilities. One thing they all have in common, however, is that they are versatile and powerful. The power of SQL must be wielded carefully. An ill-considered DELETE or DROP function could erase a database of vital information with millions and even billions of rows. Thus, it is always good practice to test SQL queries in a controlled context before implementing them.
