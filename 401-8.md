## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, facilitating the placement of all kinds of objects into lists using this techinque.

Standard list creation and list comprehension techniques are compared below.

- Standard

```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```

- List Comprehension

```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```

### Examples of List Comprehensions

```
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x

# This will give the output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

```
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

```
list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
 
print multiplied 
[9,12,15]
```

```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
```

```
string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers

>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```

### More Complex Uses of List Comprehensions

#### File Reading

```
fh = open("test.txt", "r")

result = [i for i in fh if "line3" in i]

print result

>>['this is line3']
```

#### Functions

```
>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
```
