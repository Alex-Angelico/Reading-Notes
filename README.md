# Cultivating a Growth Mindset

## Defining Growth Mindset
The growth mindset is something that everybody is capable of obtaining. It is a set of habits and attitudes to
learning and doing things which will allow you develop entirely new aspects of yourself, while helping others
to do the same.

- _Opening_ up to your own potential
- _Embracing_ failure and learning from it
- _Supporting_ others in their pursuits
- _Reaching_ outside your comfort zone to overcome challenges

**Having a Growth Mindset can help you succeed in the harshest of environments!**
