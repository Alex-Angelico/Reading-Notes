# Cultivating a Growth Mindset

## Defining Growth Mindset
The growth mindset is something that everybody is capable of obtaining. It is a set of habits and attitudes to
learning and doing things which will allow you develop entirely new aspects of yourself, while helping others
to do the same.

- Being open to your own potential
- Embracing failure and learning from it
- Supporting others in their pursuits
- Reaching outside your comfort zone to overcome challenges
