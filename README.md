# Cultivating a Growth Mindset
The growth mindset is something that everybody is capable of obtaining. It is a set of habits and attitudes to
learning and doing things which will allow you develop entirely new aspects of yourself, while helping others
to do the same.

## Defining Growth Mindset
The fundamental priciples of growth mindset are:
- _Opening_ up to your own potential
- _Embracing_ failure and learning from it
- _Supporting_ others in their pursuits
- _Reaching_ outside your comfort zone to overcome challenges

### 3 Reminders on How to Keep a Growth Mindset
- Apply your full attention to learning the concepts that you need to excel at a challenge.
- Break your challenges down into manageable tasks that you can tackle separately.
- Check your own progress frequently. If you're stuck, seek help - whether it's from a mentor, a peer, or the internet.

**Having a Growth Mindset can help you succeed in the harshest of environments!**

# Some Basics on Text Editors and Terminal

## Why Developers Need to Be Thoughtful About Their Text Editor Choice
Simply put, text editors are an essential if not the most essential tool a web developer utilizes in their job.
This is because text editors are where developers write and manage code to build a website. Key features of
various text editors which help facilitate this are:
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Variety of visual themes to prevent eye strain
- Compatibility with a variety of optional extensions for different uses

In finding a text editor that offers these features and more, there is no one right answer for all developers.
There is no perfect text editor. And this is why it's imoprtant that developers put thought into the text editor
they are personally going to use. Many options exist, and some will be more compatible with one's specific style
and technical requirement than others.

### How Text Editors Are Classified
Stricly speaking, text editors come in two types:
- First-party (pre-installed on your computer, come with few or any features to make writing code easier, e.g. Notepad)
- Third-party (must be downloaded and installed, but come with some or all of the highly useful features listed above, e.g. Notepad++)

Alternatively, developers may choose to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). IDEs are a full software package
which include a text editor along with a file manager, compiler and debugger. Hence they allow developers to write, test,
and organize code all in one system.

### My Cheat Sheet for Basic Terminal Usage
**First Things First**
- Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll up and down through the terminal history to recall commands you have already used in an operating instance if you want to use them again.
- Use the left and right arrow keys to edit previous commands if you need to change parameters on subsequent uses.

**Specific Commands**
- **pwd**: "Print Working Directory" - shows you what directory you're currently running Terminal in
- **ls**: "List" - displays file and directory objects in your working directory (can be appended "ls -a" to include hidden objects)
- **cd**: "Change Directory" - moves the Terminal instance to another working directory using a specified path
