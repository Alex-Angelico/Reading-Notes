# Introduction to My Reading Notes

Hello! I'm Alex. You can learn more about me [here](introduction.md).

This is a repository for all of the notes I have written for my software developer certification program at Code Fellows, organized by course level and day.

The main programming laguages covered by the certification and within my notes are:
- **HTML:** (HyperText Markup Language) The fundamental language utilized to build websites.
- **CSS:** (Cascading Style Sheets) A language which provides a wide array of tools for customizing the visual presentation of HTML-rendered web pages.
- **JavaScript:** Highly adaptive language that facilitates dynamic user interaction with pages.
- **Python:** A powerful, intuitive, back-end focused programming languages with numerous applications in data science and analysis.

_This is not an exhaustive list of concepts and tools explored in this repository. Many other topics pertaining to best practices for software development will receive focus._
