## Dunder Methods

Dunder methods are special, predefined methods used to enrich classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example `__init__` or `__str__`. Broadly, they allow user-defined object types to emulate the behavior of built-in object types. This allows custom objects to return standard data such as length or a slice.

### Further Examples of How Custom Objects Can Be Enriched With Dunder

- Initialization of new objects
- Object representation
- Enable iteration
- Operator overloading (comparison)
- Operator overloading (addition)
- Method invocation
- Context manager support (with statement)

#### Object Initialization: `__init__`

The constructor takes care of setting up the object with various standardized properties

#### Object Representation: `__repr__`, `__str__`

1. `__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object. The goal of `__repr__` is to be unambiguous about an object instance's properties.

2. `__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object intended for end user consumption.

#### Iteration: `__len__`, `__getitem__`, `__reversed__`

##### Examples

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
```

```
def __reversed__(self):
    return self[::-1]

>>> list(reversed(acc))
[30, -20, 50, -10, 20]
```

#### Operator Overloading for Comparing Accounts: `__eq__`, `__lt__`

```
>>> acc2 = Account('tim', 100)
>>> acc2.add_transaction(20)
>>> acc2.add_transaction(40)
>>> acc2.balance

from functools import total_ordering

@total_ordering
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __eq__(self, other):
        return self.balance == other.balance

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.balance < other.balance

>>> acc2 > acc
True

>>> acc2 < acc
False

>>> acc == acc2
False
```

#### Operator Overloading for Merging Accounts: `__add__`

##### Complex

```
def __add__(self, other):
    owner = '{}&{}'.format(self.owner, other.owner)
    start_amount = self.amount + other.amount
    acc = Account(owner, start_amount)
    for t in list(self) + list(other):
        acc.add_transaction(t)
    return acc
```

##### Simplified

```
def __add__(self, other):
    owner = self.owner + other.owner
    start_amount = self.balance + other.balance
    return Account(owner, start_amount)
```

#### Callable Python Objects: `__call__`

An object can be made callable like a regular function by adding the `__call__` dunder method.

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __call__(self):
        print('Start amount: {}'.format(self.amount))
        print('Transactions: ')
        for transaction in self:
            print(transaction)
        print('\nBalance: {}'.format(self.balance))

>>> acc = Account('bob', 10)
>>> acc.add_transaction(20)
>>> acc.add_transaction(-10)
>>> acc.add_transaction(50)
>>> acc.add_transaction(-20)
>>> acc.add_transaction(30)

>>> acc()
Start amount: 10
Transactions:
20
-10
50
-20
30
Balance: 80
```

#### Context Manager Support and the With Statement: `__enter__`, `__exit__`

A context manager is a simple “protocol” (or interface) that an object needs to follow so it can be used with the with statement. To implement a functioning context manager, an object class must inclued `__enter__` and `__exit__` dunder methods.

##### Example Based on Simple Monetary Account Objects

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __enter__(self):
        print('ENTER WITH: Making backup of transactions for rollback')
        self._copy_transactions = list(self._transactions)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        print('EXIT WITH:', end=' ')
        if exc_type:
            self._transactions = self._copy_transactions
            print('Rolling back to previous transactions')
            print('Transaction resulted in {} ({})'.format(
                exc_type.__name__, exc_val))
        else:
            print('Transaction OK')

def validate_transaction(acc, amount_to_add):
    with acc as a:
        print('Adding {} to account'.format(amount_to_add))
        a.add_transaction(amount_to_add)
        print('New balance would be: {}'.format(a.balance))
        if a.balance < 0:
            raise ValueError('sorry cannot go in debt!')
```

###### Output from Adding a Positive Amount

```
acc4 = Account('sue', 10)

print('\nBalance start: {}'.format(acc4.balance))
validate_transaction(acc4, 20)

print('\nBalance end: {}'.format(acc4.balance))

>>> Balance start: 10
>>> ENTER WITH: Making backup of transactions for rollback
>>> Adding 20 to account
>>> New balance would be: 30
>>> EXIT WITH: Transaction OK
>>> Balance end: 30
```

###### Output from Withdrawing Too Much

```
acc4 = Account('sue', 10)

print('\nBalance start: {}'.format(acc4.balance))
try:
    validate_transaction(acc4, -50)
except ValueError as exc:
    print(exc)

print('\nBalance end: {}'.format(acc4.balance))

Balance start: 10
ENTER WITH: Making backup of transactions for rollback
Adding -50 to account
New balance would be: -40
EXIT WITH: Rolling back to previous transactions
ValueError: sorry cannot go in debt!
Balance end: 10
```

## Statistics and Probability

### Defining Probability

At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” - where an event is some outcome of interest. The set of all possible events that can occur is called a sample space. By looking at the events that can occur, probability gives a framework for making predictions about how often events will happen.

Statistics apply mathematical methods to real world observations to determine how closely such observations match theoretical probability. For example, statistics could be used to measure how often a coin is likely to land on heads or tails.

### From Statistics to Probability

An example of a function for performing statistical analysis on coin flips is below.

```
import random
def coin_trial():
heads = 0
for i in range(100):
    if random.random() <= 0.5:
        heads +=1
    return heads
def simulate(n):
    trials = []
    for i in range(n):
        trials.append(coin_trial())
    return(sum(trials)/n)
simulate(10)
>>> 5.4
simulate(100)
>>> 4.83
simulate(1000)
>>> 5.055
simulate(1000000)
>>> 4.999781
```

The coin_trial function is what represents a simulation of 10 coin tosses. It uses the random() function to generate a float between 0 and 1, and increments our heads count if it’s within half of that range.

Python saves a lot of time by allowing developers to model real-world processes like this in code. Probability provides the theory, while statistical programs provide the tools to test the theory using data in various contexts - even with great degrees of complexity.

### Data Distributions

A dataset subjected to statistical analysis is likely to comport to some probabalistic model which illustrates the relative probability of different events in the sample set occurring. The most important of these models is the normal distribution.

_Important note: While intuitively representing the same thing, statistical and probabalistic models of data illustrate slightly different things. This can be seen below._
