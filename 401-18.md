## Introducing the Caesar Cipher

Encryption has been practiced by people for thousands of years. One of the earliest encyption techniques was invented by Julius Caesar. The Caesar Cipher is simple and widely-known, making it a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking.

## Encryption Method

The Caesar Cipher uses a basic substitution pattern to scramble plain text words by replacing their letters with other letters a fixed number of positions away. According to Roman historian Suetonius, Caesar used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when encrypting, and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of military significance. While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.

It is unknown how effective the Caesar cipher was at the time, but it is likely to have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language.[7] There is no record at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers.

## Decryption Method

The earliest surviving records of decryption solutions date to the 9th-century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis. For example, "E" is the most popular letter in the English language. One can analyze the frequency of the characters in a message and identify the most likely "E" and narrow down the possible shift amounts based on that.

Otherwise, There are only 25 possible shifts, corresponding to the 25 other letters in the alphabet that a given letter may have been numerically shifted to. The enemy could take some time to try out each of them and find one that yielded a sensible message. They wouldn't even need to try the shifts on the entire message--just the first word or two.
