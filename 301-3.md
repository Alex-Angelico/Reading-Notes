# Reading 3: HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## Templating with Mustache

With JavaScript templating it it fast and easy to render client-side HTML templates extracted from a JSON data cource. The HTML markup will includ template tags that can either insert variables or execute code. During runtime, the template engine replaces variable and other instances in the template firle with actual values, and the converted HTML file is sent on to the client.

Mustache template syntax is logicless, and can be used not only for HTML, but config files, source code, and more. It expands tags in a template provided by a hatch or object. These mustache tags are the only feature of the syntax, replacing things like conditional and loop constructs.

'mustache.js' is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript. It is often considered the base for JavaScript templating. Since mustache supports various languages, no separate templating system is required on the server side.

_Note: mustache is NOT a templating engine; it is a specification for a templating language._

## Using Flexbox

[Master Reference](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

Contains instructions for:

- `display`: This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.
- `order`: By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container.
- `flex-direction`: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
- `flex-grow`: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up.
- `flex-wrap`: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.
- `flex-shrink`: This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
- `flex-flow`: This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
- `flex-basis`: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed.
- `justify-content`: This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size.
- `flex`: This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, it’s like 1 0.
- `align-self`: This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items.
- `align-items`: This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
- `align-content`: This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
