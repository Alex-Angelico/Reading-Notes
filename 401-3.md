# 3 - File I/O & Exceptions

## File I/O

In modern compuyer systems, fies come in thousands of formats that are used for different purposes. But they generally have three components:

1. **Header:** Fuke name, size, type, etc.
2. **Data:** Readable contents for manipulation by users and programs.
3. **End of File (EOF):** A special character that indicates the end of the file.

### File Paths and Line Endings

#### Windows

**File paths:** Backlash (\\) as directory separators.
**Line endings:** Carriage return and line feed (\\r\\n).

#### Unix

**File paths:** Forward slash (/) as directory separators.
**Line endings:** Carriage return and line feed (\\n).

### Character Encoding Standards

Common encoding standards use a numerical value to represent unique characters, such as letters of the alphabet.

**UNICODE:** Can contain up to 1114112 unique characters.
**ASCII:** A subset of UNICODE that only contains 128 characters.

_Note: If one attempts to parse a UNICODE-encoded file using ASCII, an error will result if the program attempts to read a character from outside the ASCII subset.

To open a file in python, use a variable to contain the value of `open('filename', mode)`.

It’s important to remember to close the file. In most cases, upon termination of an application or script, a file will be closed eventually. However, there is no guarantee when exactly that will happen. This can lead to unwanted behavior including resource leaks. It’s also a best practice within Python (Pythonic) to ensure code behaves in a way that is well defined and reduces any unwanted behavior.

When manipulating a file, there are two ways to ensure that a file is closed properly, even when encountering an error. The first way to close a file is to use the try-finally block:

```
file = open('filename', 'mode')

try:
  # file processing instructions
finally:
  file.close()
```

Alternatively, a with statement can be used.

```
with open('filename', 'mode') as file:
  # File processing instructions
```

The with statement automatically takes care of closing the file once it leaves the with block, even if an error occurs.

Additionally, the second parameter `mode` is used to designate how the file will be opened.

Character | Meaning
--------- | -------
'r' | Open for reading (default)
'w' | Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
'rb' or 'wb' | Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)

### Reading and Writing Opened Files

#### Reading

Method | Purpose
------ | -------------
.read(size=-1) | This reads from the file based on the number of size bytes. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire file is read.
.readline(size=-1) | This reads at most size number of characters from the line. This continues to the end of the line and then wraps back around. If no argument is passed or None or -1 is passed, then the entire line (or rest of the line) is read.
.readlines() | This reads the remaining lines from the file object and returns them as a list.

#### Writing

Method | Purpose
------ | -------------
.write(string) | This writes the string to the file.
.writelines(seq) | This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. It’s up to you to add the appropriate line ending(s).

### Useful Tips

#### `__file__`

The `__file__` attribute is a special attribute of modules, similar to `__name__`. It returns the path relative to where the initial Python script was called. For the full system path, can use `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory of the executing code.

#### Appending to a File

This is easily done by using the 'a' character for the mode argument:

```
with open('filename', 'a') as file:
  file.write('text')
```

#### Working With Two Files at the Same Time

Reading from one file and writing to another can be achieved through the following:

```
readfile = 'readfilename'
writefile = 'writefilename'
with open(readfile, 'r') as fileread, open(writefile, 'w') as filewrite:
    data = fileread.readlines()
    filewrite.writelines(reversed(data))
```

#### Creating a Context Manager

Finer control of a file object can be obtained by placing it inside a custom class. When doing this, using the with statement will require the addition of special methods: `__enter__` and `__exit__`. Adding these creates a context manager.

`__enter__()` is invoked when calling the with statement. `__exit__()` is called upon exiting from the with statement block. Below is a template for a custom class using both:

```
class my_file_reader():
    def __init__(self, file_path):
        self.__path = file_path
        self.__file_object = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self.__file_object = open(self.__path)
        return self

    def __exit__(self, type, val, tb):
        self.__file_object.close()

    # Additional methods can be implemented below
```

## Exceptions

### Exceptions vs Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement. For example:

```
>>> print( 0 / 0 ))
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

The arrow indicates where the parser ran into the syntax error. In this example, there was one bracket too many. When it is removed:

```
>>> print( 0 / 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero
```

This time, an exception error results instead. This type of error occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error.

Instead of showing the message exception error, Python details what type of exception error was encountered. In this case, it was a ZeroDivisionError. Python comes with various built-in exceptions as well as the possibility to create self-defined exceptions.
