# Read: 10 - The Call Stack and Debugging

## An Introduciton to JavaScript's Call Stack

A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.

- When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
- Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
- When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.
- If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a "stack overflow" error.

At the most basic level, a call stack is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocations. A runtime starts with an empty call stack. Whenever a function is invoked, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the call stack. Ultimately, the stack is empty again. Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous.

However, understanding of the call stack is vital to asynchronous programming. In asynchronous JavaScript, there is a callback function, an event loop, and a task queue. The callback function is acted upon by the call stack during execution after the call back function has been pushed to the stack by the event loop.

_Note: A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error._

## Error Messages and Debugging

### Types of Errors

- **Reference** - Attempting to use variables that have not yet been declared. This is especially common when using `const` and `let` declarators, due there being a measurable time between when htey are hoisted and declared calle the temporal dead zone. The esline library helps avoid many of these issues before executino.
- **Syntax** - Uncontrolled execution termination caused by the interpreter coming across code that cannot be syntacically parsed (e.g. using `JSON.parse` on and invalid object). Some syntax errors like sending a trailing comma when calling a function are handled without error by most recent browsers, but older ones you have to be careful. Eslint is useful here as well.
- **Range** - The result of trying to manipulate an object in a way that involves an invalid length dimension (e.g. applying negative length to an array).
- **Type** - Produced when manipulating incompatible or undefined data types and objects. Very common in JS due it being a weakly typed language. This can be remediated by using JS with the TypeScript library, which is widely adopted.
