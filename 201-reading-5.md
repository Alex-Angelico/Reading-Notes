# Reading 5: HTML Images, CSS Color & Text

## Chapter 5 of HTML/CSS

Images can be modified in many ways using CSS for resizing, repositioning, and editing how exactly their graphical content appears. This being the case, there are three important rules to remember when creating images.

1. _Save images in the correct format_
2. _Save images at the correct size_
3. _Measure images in pixels_

There are also very good online editors which can be used for more complex editing, such as:

- [Photoshop](www.photoshop.com)
- [PIXLR](www.pixlr.com)
- [iPiccy](www.ipiccy.com)

HTML5 has also introduced the elements `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to make it easy to create images with properly associated and stylized captions.

## Chapter 11 of HTML/CSS

One of the basic and most versatile building blocks of CSS is color. The two most common color properties in CSS are:

- `color`: determines text color
- `background-color`: determines background

Color can be adjusted through several different value types:

- RGB(A) (Red, Green, Blue, (Alpha))
- HSL(A) (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, (Alpha))
- Hex code
- Color names

In the above examples, the Alpha value is a secondary, optional value which is not directly tied to color, but rather determines opacity. It is expressed as a percentage.

What is most imporatnat in considering color schemes within CSS is to use combinations of colors for backgrounds and text that provide sufficient but not excessive contrast, ensuring maximum readability for users.

## Chapter 12 of HTML/CSS

Text on websites can be modified by font, size, weight, style, and spacing--all through CSS. Regarding fonts specifically, there is a limited set from which it is recommended that site developers draw--those being the ones most commonly installed across user devices. There are certainly more typefaces avaialbe for developers to use; however, they generally must be appropriately licensed.

One of the most dynamic ways in which the appearance of page text can be manipulated through HTML and CSS is by way of pseudo-classes, which change the style of text contained in an element when a user hovers on or clicks on it.
