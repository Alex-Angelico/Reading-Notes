## Understanding REST

The World Wide Web, undergirded by the HyperText Transfer Protocol, can be thought of as a global positioning system for digital information that can connect anything in the world to anyhting else in the world. The architectural style in which this system is built is called REST. REST defines the nature of web resources--the websites pointed to by HTTP Universal Resource Locators (aka URLs).

However, in the purest sense, websites themselves are only representation of resources. The resource itself is the concepts embodied by the website. But websites are not at all the exclusive form of representation for resources on the web. Increasingly, other forms are being used, such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

In a sense, APIs represent to computers what websites do to their human users: they facilitate massive numbers of client machines from all over the world interacting with a concept. Moreover, APIs allow computers to share and communicate large volumes of data. And as with websites for humans, APIs for computers are encapsulated entirely within a URL. Hence URLs function as nouns for internet-connected computers--they are like a fundamental linguistic component that machines can use to communicate.

REST provides these computers with an equally important linguistic equivalent: verbs. This is achieved via the principle of **polymorphism**: in other words, the fact that a given noun can be subjected to many different verbs. HTTP fundamentally is concerned with applying different verbs to nouns - for instance, the verb GET can be applied from anything to retrieving a website itself, to all of its audiovisual and textual assets.

The challenge lies in realizing and exploiting a whole host of other possible verbs to apply to websites and APIs. Doing this will make for a much richer, more productive, and effective web for both humans and computers.
