# 13 - Linear Regressions

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning. It contains functions for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

Of these, the sklearn.linear_model module contains methods intended for regression in which the target value is expected to be a linear combination of the input variables.

Implementation of linear regression in a Python program will generally require the following imporation stack:

```
%matplotlib inline

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

The sklearn linear regression class would be imported like so:

```
from sklear.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:

- lm.fit() -> Fits a linear model.
- lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients.
- lm.score() -> Returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.

Additionally, a specific dataset (for example, Boston housing data) from sklearn can be imported like so:

```
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
boston = load_boston()
```

Here are basic commands that can be used to view the dataset's dimensions, properties, and content.

- `boston.keys` - Keys for accessing below information
- `boston.data.shape` - Dimensions of dataset
- `boston.feature_names` Dataset column names
- `boston.DESCR` - Notes on the dataset
- `boston.data` - The actual data
- `boston.target` - Contains a specific subset of data
