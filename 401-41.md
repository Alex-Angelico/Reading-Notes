### Page Path Depends on External Data

In the previous lesson, we covered the case where the page content depends on external data. We used getStaticProps to fetch required data to render the index page.

In this lesson, weâ€™ll talk about the case where each page path depends on external data. Next.js allows you to statically generate pages with paths that depend on external data. This enables dynamic URLs in Next.js.
