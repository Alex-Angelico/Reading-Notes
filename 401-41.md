## [Dynamic Routes](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/dynamic-routes)

### Page Path Depends on External Data

In the previous lesson, we covered the case where the page content depends on external data. We used getStaticProps to fetch required data to render the index page.

In this lesson, we’ll talk about the case where each page path depends on external data. Next.js allows you to statically generate pages with paths that depend on external data. This enables dynamic URLs in Next.js.

![Generating Links With External Data](assets/401/page-path-external-data.png)

#### How to Statically Generate Pages with Dynamic Routes

In our case, we want to create dynamic routes for blog posts:

```
We want each post to have the path /posts/<id>, where <id> is the name of the markdown file under the top-level posts directory.
Since we have ssg-ssr.md and pre-rendering.md, we’d like the paths to be /posts/ssg-ssr and /posts/pre-rendering.
```

#### Overview of the Steps

We can do this by taking the following steps. You don’t have to make these changes yet — we’ll do it all on the next page.

First, we’ll create a page called [id].js under pages/posts. Pages that begin with [ and end with ] are dynamic routes in Next.js.

In pages/posts/[id].js, we’ll write code that will render a post page — just like other pages we’ve created.

```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}
```

Now, here’s what’s new: We’ll export an async function called getStaticPaths from this page. In this function, we need to return a list of possible values for id.

```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible value for id
}
```

Finally, we need to implement getStaticProps again - this time, to fetch necessary data for the blog post with a given id. getStaticProps is given params, which contains id (because the file name is [id].js).

```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Return a list of possible value for id
}

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Fetch necessary data for the blog post using params.id
}
```

Here’s a graphic summary of what we just talked about:

![Static Pages Dynamic Routes](assets/401/how-to-dynamic-routes.png)

#### Implement getStaticPaths

First, let’s set up the files:

- Create a file called [id].js inside the pages/posts directory.
- Also, remove first-post.js inside the pages/posts directory — we’ll no longer use this.

Then, open pages/posts/[id].js in your editor and paste the following code. We’ll fill in ... later:

```
import Layout from '../../components/layout'

export default function Post() {
  return <Layout>...</Layout>
}
```

Then, open lib/posts.js and add the following getAllPostIds function at the bottom. It will return the list of file names (excluding .md) in the posts directory:

```
export function getAllPostIds() {
  const fileNames = fs.readdirSync(postsDirectory)

  // Returns an array that looks like this:
  // [
  //   {
  //     params: {
  //       id: 'ssg-ssr'
  //     }
  //   },
  //   {
  //     params: {
  //       id: 'pre-rendering'
  //     }
  //   }
  // ]
  return fileNames.map(fileName => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: fileName.replace(/\.md$/, '')
      }
    }
  })
}
```

*Note: The returned list is not just an array of strings — it must be an array of objects that look like the comment above. Each object must have the params key and contain an object with the id key (because we’re using [id] in the file name). Otherwise, getStaticPaths will fail.*

Finally, we'll import the getAllPostIds function and use it inside getStaticPaths. Open pages/posts/[id].js and copy the following code above the exported Post component:

```
import { getAllPostIds } from '../../lib/posts'

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = getAllPostIds()
  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false
  }
}
```

- paths contains the array of known paths returned by getAllPostIds(), which include the params defined by pages/posts/[id].js. 
- Ignore fallback: false for now — we’ll explain that later.

We’re almost done — but we still need to implement getStaticProps. Let’s do that on the next page!

#### Implement getStaticProps

We need to fetch necessary data to render the post with the given id.

To do so, open lib/posts.js again and add the following getPostData function at the bottom. It will return the post data based on id:

```
export function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

  // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
  const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

  // Combine the data with the id
  return {
    id,
    ...matterResult.data
  }
}
```

Then, open pages/posts/[id].js and replace this line:

```
import { getAllPostIds } from '../../lib/
posts'
```

with the following code:

```
import { getAllPostIds, getPostData } from '../../lib/posts'

export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const postData = getPostData(params.id)
  return {
    props: {
      postData
    }
  }
}
```

The post page is now using the getPostData function in getStaticProps to get the post data and return it as props.

Now, let's update the Post component to use postData. In pages/posts/[id].js replace the exported Post component with the following code:

```
export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {postData.title}
      <br />
      {postData.id}
      <br />
      {postData.date}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

#### Render Markdown

To render markdown content, we’ll use the remark library. First, let’s install it:

```
npm install remark remark-html
```

Then, open lib/posts.js and add the following imports to the top of the file:

```
import remark from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'
```

And update the getPostData() function in the same file as follows to use remark:

```
export async function getPostData(id) {
  const fullPath = path.join(postsDirectory, `${id}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')

  // Use gray-matter to parse the post metadata section
  const matterResult = matter(fileContents)

  // Use remark to convert markdown into HTML string
  const processedContent = await remark()
    .use(html)
    .process(matterResult.content)
  const contentHtml = processedContent.toString()

  // Combine the data with the id and contentHtml
  return {
    id,
    contentHtml,
    ...matterResult.data
  }
}
```

*Note: We added the async keyword to getPostData because we need to use await for remark. async/await allow you to fetch data asynchronously.*

That means we need to update getStaticProps in pages/posts/[id].js to use await when calling getPostData:

```
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // Add the "await" keyword like this:
  const postData = await getPostData(params.id)
  // ...
}
```

Finally, update the Post component in pages/posts/[id].js to render contentHtml using dangerouslySetInnerHTML:

```
export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {postData.title}
      <br />
      {postData.id}
      <br />
      {postData.date}
      <br />
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.contentHtml }} />
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

#### Polishing the Post Page

Adding title to the Post Page
In pages/posts/[id].js, let’s add the title tag using the post data. You'll need to add an import for next/head at the top of the file and add the title tag by updating the Post component:

```
// Add this import
import Head from 'next/head'

export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* Add this <Head> tag */}
      <Head>
        <title>{postData.title}</title>
      </Head>

      {/* Keep the existing code here */}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

#### Formatting the Date

To format the date, we’ll use the date-fns library. First, install it:

```
npm install date-fns
```

Next, create a file called components/date.js and add the following Date component:

```
import { parseISO, format } from 'date-fns'

export default function Date({ dateString }) {
  const date = parseISO(dateString)
  return <time dateTime={dateString}>{format(date, 'LLLL d, yyyy')}</time>
}
```

*Note: You can view the different format() string options here.*

Now, open pages/posts/[id].js, add an import for the Date component at the top of the file, and use it over {postData.date}:

```
// Add this import
import Date from '../../components/date'

export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      {/* Keep the existing code here */}

      {/* Replace {postData.date} with this */}
      <Date dateString={postData.date} />

      {/* Keep the existing code here */}
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

If you access http://localhost:3000/posts/pre-rendering, you should now see the date written as “January 1, 2020”.

#### Adding CSS

Finally, let’s add some CSS using the file styles/utils.module.css we added before. Open pages/posts/[id].js, then add an import for the CSS file, and replace the Post component with the following code:

```
// Add this import at the top of the file
import utilStyles from '../../styles/utils.module.css'

export default function Post({ postData }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Head>
        <title>{postData.title}</title>
      </Head>
      <article>
        <h1 className={utilStyles.headingXl}>{postData.title}</h1>
        <div className={utilStyles.lightText}>
          <Date dateString={postData.date} />
        </div>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: postData.contentHtml }} />
      </article>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

#### Polishing the Index Page

Next, let’s update our index page (pages/index.js). We need to add links to each post page using the Link component.

Open pages/index.js and add the following imports at the top of the file for Link and Date:

```
import Link from 'next/link'
import Date from '../components/date'
```

Then, near the bottom of the Home component in the same file, replace the li tag with the following:

```
<li className={utilStyles.listItem} key={id}>
  <Link href={`/posts/${id}`}>
    <a>{title}</a>
  </Link>
  <br />
  <small className={utilStyles.lightText}>
    <Date dateString={date} />
  </small>
</li>
```

#### Dynamic Routes Details

Here is some essential information you should know about dynamic routes.

Fetch External API or Query Database
Like getStaticProps, getStaticPaths can fetch data from any data source. In our example, getAllPostIds (which is used by getStaticPaths) may fetch from an external API endpoint:

```
export async function getAllPostIds() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..')
  const posts = await res.json()
  return posts.map(post => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: post.id
      }
    }
  })
}
```

#### Development vs Production

In development (npm run dev or yarn dev), getStaticPaths runs on every request.
In production, getStaticPaths runs at build time.

#### Fallback

Recall that we returned fallback: false from getStaticPaths. What does this mean?

If fallback is false, then any paths not returned by getStaticPaths will result in a 404 page.

If fallback is true, then the behavior of getStaticProps changes:

- The paths returned from getStaticPaths will be rendered to HTML at build time.
- The paths that have not been generated at build time will not result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a “fallback” version of the page on the first request to such a path.
- In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

If fallback is blocking, then new paths will be server-side rendered with getStaticProps, and cached for future requests so it only happens once per path.

This is beyond the scope of our lessons, but you can learn more about fallback: true and fallback: 'blocking' in the fallback documentation.

#### Catch-all Routes

Dynamic routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (...) inside the brackets. For example, pages/posts/[...id].js matches /posts/a, but also /posts/a/b, /posts/a/b/c and so on.

If you do this, in getStaticPaths, you must return an array as the value of the id key like so:

```
return [
  {
    params: {
      // Statically Generates /posts/a/b/c
      id: ['a', 'b', 'c']
    }
  }
  //...
]
```

And params.id will be an array in getStaticProps:

```
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // params.id will be like ['a', 'b', 'c']
}
```

Take a look at the catch all routes documentation to learn more.

#### Router

If you want to access the Next.js router, you can do so by importing the useRouter hook from next/router.

#### 404 Pages

To create a custom 404 page, create pages/404.js. This file is statically generated at build time.

```
// pages/404.js
export default function Custom404() {
  return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
}
```

## [Deploying a Next.js App](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/deploying-nextjs-app)

### Rapid Deployment

#### Push to GitHub

Before we deploy, let’s push our Next.js app to GitHub if you haven’t done so already. This will make deployment easier.

On your personal GitHub account, create a new repository called nextjs-blog.
The repository can be public or private. You do not need to initialize it with a README or other files.
If you need help setting up your repo, take a look at this guide on GitHub.
Then:

If you haven’t initialized the git repository locally for your Next.js app, do so now.
Push the Next.js app to your GitHub repository.
To push to GitHub, you can run the following commands (replace <username> with your GitHub username):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/nextjs-blog.git
git push -u origin main
```

#### Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & JAMstack deployment and Serverless Functions. We believe Vercel is the optimal place to deploy Next.js apps. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.

#### Create a Vercel Account

First, go to https://vercel.com/signup to create a Vercel account. Choose Continue with GitHub and go through the sign up process.

#### Import your nextjs-blog repository

Once you’re signed up, import your nextjs-blog repository on Vercel. You can do so from here: https://vercel.com/import/git.

- You’ll need to Install Vercel for GitHub. You can give it access to All Repositories.
- Once you’ve installed Vercel, import nextjs-blog.

You can use default values for the following settings — no need to change anything. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

- Project Name
- Root Directory
- Build Command
- Output Directory
- Development Command

When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.

*Note: Help is available: If your deployment fails, you can always get help on GitHub Discussions. To learn more about deployment, take a look at our documentation.*

When it’s done, you’ll get deployment URLs. Click on one of the URLs and you should see the Next.js starter page live.

#### Next.js and Vercel

Vercel is made by the creators of Next.js and has first-class support for Next.js. When you deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the following happens by default:

- Pages that use Static Generation and assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts, etc) will automatically be served from the Vercel Edge Network, which is blazingly fast.
- Pages that use Server-Side Rendering and API routes will automatically become isolated Serverless Functions. This allows page rendering and API requests to scale infinitely.

Vercel has many more features, such as:

- **Custom Domains:** Once deployed on Vercel, you can assign a custom domain to your Next.js app. Take a look at our documentation here.
- **Environment Variables:** You can also set environment variables on Vercel. Take a look at our documentation here. You can then use those environment variables in your Next.js app.
- **Automatic HTTPS:** HTTPS is enabled by default (including custom domains) and doesn't require extra configuration. We auto-renew SSL certificates.

You can learn more about the platform in the Vercel documentation.

#### Preview Deployment for Every Push

*Note: The steps below are optional — you can try it or just read it through.*

After deploying to Vercel, try doing the following if you can:

- Create a new branch on your app.
- Make some changes and push to GitHub.
- Create a new pull request (GitHub help page).

You should see a comment by the vercel bot on the pull request page.

Try clicking on the Preview URL inside this comment. You should see the changes you just made.

When you have a pull request open, Vercel automatically creates a preview deployment for that branch on every push. The preview URL will always point to the latest preview deployment.

You can share this preview URL with your collaborators and get immediate feedback.

If your preview deployment looks good, merge it to main. When you do this, Vercel automatically creates a production deployment.

#### Develop, Preview, Ship

We’ve just gone through the workflow we call DPS: Develop, Preview, and Ship.

- **Develop:** We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
- **Preview:** We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and Vercel created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing code reviews, you can do deployment previews.
- **Ship:** We’ve merged the pull request to main to ship to production.

We strongly recommend using this workflow when developing Next.js apps — it will help you iterate on your app faster.

#### Other Hosting Options

Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider that supports Node.js.

If you’ve followed the instructions so far, your package.json should have the following build and start scripts:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

In your own hosting provider, run the build script once, which builds the production application in the .next folder.

```
npm run build
```

After building, the start script starts a Node.js server that supports hybrid pages, serving both statically generated and server-side rendered pages, and API Routes.

```
npm run start
```

*Tip: You can customize the start script in package.json to accept a PORT parameter by updating it as: "start": "next start -p $PORT".*
