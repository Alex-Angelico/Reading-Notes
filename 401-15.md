# 15 - Trees

## Common Terminology

- Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
- Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
- Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
- Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
- Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node

## Binary Trees

Binary Trees restrict the number of children a given node can have to two (hence our left and right children). There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like:

### Adding Nodes

Because there are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree, it really doesn’t matter where a new node gets placed.

One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down using breadth first traversal. The traversal finds the first node that does not have 2 child nodes, and inserts the new node as a child.

Alternatively, to place the new node in a specific location, reference both the new node to create, and the parent node upon which the child is attached to.

### Binary Tree Big O

The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n). Because of the lack of organizational structure in a Binary Tree, the worst case for most operations will involve traversing the entire tree.

The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree. For example, in the above tree, w is 4.

A “perfect” binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The maximum width for a perfect binary tree, is 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Height can be calculated as log n, where n is the number of nodes.

## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

Here is how the above Binary Tree example would be reformed into a Binary Search Tree:

### Searching a BST

Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all that is necessary is to compare the node being searched for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, only traverse the right side.

The best way to approach a BST search is with a while loop.

### BST Big O

The Big O time complexity of a Binary Search Tree’s insertion and search operations is O(h), or O(height). In the worst case, it will be necessary to search all the way down to a leaf, which will require searching through as many nodes as the tree is tall. In a balanced (or “perfect”) tree, the height of the tree is log(n). In an unbalanced tree, the worst case height of the tree is n.

The Big O space complexity of a BST search would be O(1).

## Tree Traversal

### Depth First

Depth first traversal prioritizes going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which to search/print the root.

Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root

The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. Such traversals rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when the end of a sub-path is reached.

### Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node. Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.
