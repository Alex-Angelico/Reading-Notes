## An Introduction to Node.js

Node.js is a program that allows JavaScript to be executed on client computers (i.e. a runtime environment). It fully supports the latest JS--ES6 and beyond. While the latest version of Node can be easily downloaded at any time, for developers who are reliant on Node for project building, it is advisable that they use a version manager. This is a program that allows the installation of multiple versions of Node and switching between them at will. There are various advantages to using a version manager. For example, it negates potential permission issues when using Node with npm and enables setting a Node version on a per-project basis.

Instructions for installing a Node version manager can be found [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/).

### Node.js and the NPM JavaScript Package Manager

Node comes bundled with npm. The terminal commangd `npm -v` can be used to check what version of npm exists on a computer. In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry--with over 1000000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.

#### Basic NPM Terminal Commands

- `npm init -y` - This will create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder.
- `npm install [package name] --save` - Installs a specified package on a computer.

### Uses of Node.js

Node runs various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application. They can be used for anything from bundling JS files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking. To start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), deverlopers are typically expected to have a working knowledge of Node (and NPM).

Most importantly, Node is used for running JavaScript on servers. Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections. Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It is also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event. For example, when a new request comes in (one kind of event) the server will start processing it. If it then encounters a blocking I/O operation, instead of waiting for this to complete, it will register a callback before continuing to process the next event. When the I/O operation has finished (another kind of event), the server will execute the callback and continue working on the original request. Under the hood, Node uses the libuv library to implement this asynchronous (that is, non-blocking) behavior.

The traditional approach to scaling a Node app is to clone it and have the cloned instances share the workload. Node.js even has a built-in module to help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server.

The fact that Node runs in a single thread does impose some limitations. For example, blocking I/O calls should be avoided, CPU-intensive operations should be handed off to a worker thread, and errors should always be handled correctly for fear of crashing the entire process.

### Apps Suited to Node.js

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs that handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded.

Aside from speed and scalability, an often-touted advantage of using JavaScript on a web server — as well as in the browser — is that a programmer can do everything in the same language. For example, code can easily be shared between the server and the client.

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB). JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting.
