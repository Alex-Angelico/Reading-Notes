# 26 - Intro to Django

## Maintainting Django

Django is a massive, open source Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram.

Almost all popular open source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

1. Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code. This is how React (Facebook) and Angular (Google) emerged. Typically engineers at the company are paid, in part, to work on open source though community involvement from developers outside of the core company occurs as well. While this structure has the stability of a wealthy benefactor, there can be confusion around the licensing aspects at times.

2. Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control. This is the case for VueJS, Tailwind CSS, and Laravel, among others. Typically the lead developer either raises contributions directly like Evan You of VueJS, offer add-on services like Spark for Laravel, or the founders provide highly-paid consulting services.

3. Non-profit - This was Djangoâ€™s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.

### Django Software Foundation

The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. The largest expense, by far, is the Fellows Program, paid contractors who triage tickets, manage releases, and generally perform the unsexy but necessary work needed to keep Django on track.

The DSF also supports projects related to Django such as the Kickstarters for Django REST Framework 3, improved PostgreSQL support, among others. It supports related conferences that promote Django and provides funding to extend access to a diverse group of developers. Manages things such as the recent redesign of the main Django website, and more. You can see a 2014 roundup for a broader sense.

The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.

Django has a small, core team of trusted volunteers who work alongside the Django Fellows to manage technical side of the Django Project. Django Core members are divided into teams that have authority over the Django Project infrastructure, including the Django Project website itself, the official issue tracker, official mailing lists, IRC channels, and more. There is currently ongoing discussion around potentially dissolving Django core or updating it in a meaningful way.
