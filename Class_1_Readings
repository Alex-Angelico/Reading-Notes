# Cultivating a Growth Mindset
The growth mindset is something that everybody is capable of obtaining. It is a set of habits and attitudes to
learning and doing things which will allow you develop entirely new aspects of yourself, while helping others
to do the same.

## Defining Growth Mindset
The fundamental priciples of growth mindset are:
- _Opening_ up to your own potential
- _Embracing_ failure and learning from it
- _Supporting_ others in their pursuits
- _Reaching_ outside your comfort zone to overcome challenges

### 3 Reminders on How to Keep a Growth Mindset
- Apply your full attention to learning the concepts that you need to excel at a challenge.
- Break your challenges down into manageable tasks that you can tackle separately.
- Check your own progress frequently. If you're stuck, seek help - whether it's from a mentor, a peer, or the internet.

**Having a Growth Mindset can help you succeed in the harshest of environments!**
