# Reading 1: Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## Curated Introductory Notes on HTML

HTML is the backbone of all modern website architecture, providing the basic organizational structure of content on pages, and the content to populate those pages. HTML is the the most essential language to web design, as it determines how and what a user's internet browser renders when they visit a site.

The coding objects that HTML uses to create this structure and differentiate types of content are called elements. HTML5, the newest version of the language, has introduced new elements and refined existing ones to make it very easy to divide a web page into areas with specific purpose, presentation, and functionality.

These elements appear simplistic on the surface; however, they can be employed in countless configurations with different structural results  that are suitable to different kinds of websites. Thus, how a website is coded in HTML can make all the difference to attracting desired users to a page, and keeping them coming back on a regular basis.

Because of this, best practices for web design call for developers to understand who a site's users are, why they visit a site, and what they're looking for when they arrive. Creating simulated user profiles, as well as a site map that represents relationships between individual pages, are useful tools for answering these questions.

Ultimately, good HTML design will reinforce the effect of stylistic and dynamic features written in CSS and JavaScript.

## Curated Introductory Notes on JavaScript

JavaScript is a near-ubiquitous language on the modern web which provides sites with dynamic, interactive functions that make for a richer and more valuable user experience. It does so by facilitating the manipulation, input, and output of data on web pages using programmatic scripts that respond to specific conditions designated by developers.

Scripts in JavaScript are necessarily written in such a way that they can be logically executed as computer hardware instructions. To accomplish this, they are firstly dependent on the identification on discreet data objects with recognizable properties which are named and evaluated in some way. These objects are elements of HTML, and a script pertaining to a given element is triggered by a specified event involving that element (for example, a user filling in a search box). Subsequently, script methods are applied to an object to manipulate its data in some way.

Although JavaScript can be functionally written in the same file as HTML for a given page, it is considered best practice to utilize separate files for the two bodies of code. This is because it allows for greater clarity of what scripts are doing and how they are designed, and also because it allows multiple web pages on a site to draw from the same file of JavaScript for common functions. This saves time for developers, and processing resources for computers.
