## Functional Programming Concepts

In general, functional programming is oriented towards ease of system maintainability, by way of immutability of data objects and purity of the functions that act on them.

### Pure Funcitons

A pure function...

- Consistently returns one result for a given set of arguments
- Does not cause observable side effects in the program
- Is not reliant on any external data sources (e.g. reading files)
- Makes no use of things like random number generation

The advantage of pure functions is that they are easy to test.

### Immutability

Immutable data...

- Cannot change state after it has been created
- Is dependent on higher order functions in order to mutate data into different objects

The advantage of immutable data is that it makes data easy to track.

### Referential Transparency

Referential transparency is the quality of a programmatic operation that consistently yields the same output from a given input. This is the product of pure functions and immutable data being used together.

## Refactoring Tips

1. Return early from functions - don't break to a new line if it isn't necessary for clear code!
2. Cache variables to maintian readability in compound data manipulation structures such as nested loops.
3. Check for web APIs before implementing proprietary functionality to maintain codebase sericability over a longer time.
