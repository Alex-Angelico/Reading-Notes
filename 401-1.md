# 1 - Pain and Suffering, and Big O Notation

## The Difference Between Pain and Suffering

Code Fellows extolls the advantages of having a growth mindset for a very important reason: the school's advanced programming courses are meant to push students beyond their limits as they know them. They compress far more than most students learn in two years at a university into a matter of months--and with that comes pain. Pain from...

- Being pushed mentally to solve brand new problems.
- Having to spend hours in research to find paths to solutions.
- Lacking understanding on a regular basis.
- Dealing with other people's pain during collaborative projects.
- Surviving outside one's comfort zone day after day.
- Losing sleep.

It is important to remember that all of this pain is in the service of personal growth--or at least it will be, provided one takes the experience seriously enough, and reaches out to others to help bridge gaps in knowledge and understanding. Failure to do these things will lead to suffering--pain without higher purpose.

So above all, avoid suffering in silence. When pain becomes too great, look for ways to address it--bearing in mind that this is all about building new skills and emerging as a newly capable person. Build calluses, not scars.

## Big O Notation

In computer science, Big O notation is used to describe an algorithm's performance or complexity, particularly in worst-case scenarios. Specifically, it describes execution time and/or memory space required by an algorithm.

1. **O(1):** O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
2. **O(N):** O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set. The example below also demonstrates how Big O favors the worst-case performance scenario; a matching string could be found during any iteration of the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.
3. **O(N<sup>2</sup>):** O(N<sup>2</sup>) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N<sup>3</sup>), O(N<sup>4</sup>) etc.
4. **O(2<sup>N</sup>):** O(2<sup>N</sup>) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2<sup>N</sup>) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2<sup>N</sup>) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers.
