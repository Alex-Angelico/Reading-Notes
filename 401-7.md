## Python Variable Scope and the LEGB Rule

**Global** (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names defined at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in the codebase.

**Enclosing** (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that are defined in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

**The LEGB rule** is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, whe a given name is referenced, Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, the first occurrence of it will be called. Otherwise, an error will result.

### Global Scope

When a Python program is started, it begins in the global scope. Internally, Python turns the program’s main script into a __main__ module to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of the program. There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its variable names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time the program is run, the names would remember their values from the previous run.

_Note: In Python, the notions of global scope and global names are tightly associated with module files. For example, when defining a name at the top level of any Python module, then that name is considered global to the module. Thus this kind of scope is also called module scope._

To inspect the variable names within the main global scope, use dir(). Calling dir() without arguments returns the list of names that live in the current global scope. Global names can't be assigned inside functions unless they are explicitly declared as global names using a global statement.

It's important to keep in mind that global names can be updated or modified from any place in a program's global Python scope. Beyond that, the global statement can be used to modify global names from almost any place at all in the code.

Modifying global names is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:

- Difficult to debug because almost any statement in the program can change the value of a global name.
- Hard to understand due to the necessity of awareness of all the statements that access and modify global names.
- Impossible to reuse as the code is dependent on global names that are specific to a concrete program.

Good programming practice recommends using local names rather than global names, based on the following principles:

- Write self-contained functions that rely on local names rather than global ones.
- Use unique objects names, no matter the scope.
- Avoid global name modifications at any point in a program.
- Avoid cross-module name modifications.
- Use global names as constants that don’t change during a program’s execution.

#### The Global Statement

The global statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. Further, multiple global statements can be used with a name, or a list of names. All the names listed in a global statement will be mapped to the global or module scope.

_Note: The use of global is considered bad practice in general._

### Enclosing Scope

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when nesting functions inside other functions. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s local scopes. Names defined in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as nonlocal names. Names within an enclosing scope cannot be modified from inside a nested function unless they are declared as nonlocal in the nested function.

#### The Nonlocal Statement

Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated without a special nonlocal statement. But unlike global, nonlocal can’t be used outside of a nested or enclosed function. To be more precise, a nonlocal statement can't be used in either the global scope or in a local scope.

Further, in contrast to global, nonlocal cannot be used to create lazy nonlocal names. Names must already exist in the enclosing Python scope if you want to use them as nonlocal names. This means that you can’t create nonlocal names by declaring them in a nonlocal statement in a nested function.
