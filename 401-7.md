## Python Variable Scope and the LEGB Rule

**Global** (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names defined at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in the codebase.

**Enclosing** (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that are defined in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

**The LEGB rule** is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, whe a given name is referenced, Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, the first occurrence of it will be called. Otherwise, an error will result.

### Global Scope

When a Python program is started, it begins in the global scope. Internally, Python turns the program’s main script into a __main__ module to hold the main program’s execution. The namespace of this module is the main global scope of the program. There’s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its variable names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time the program is run, the names would remember their values from the previous run.

_Note: In Python, the notions of global scope and global names are tightly associated with module files. For example, when defining a name at the top level of any Python module, then that name is considered global to the module. Thus this kind of scope is also called module scope._

To inspect the variable names within the main global scope, use dir(). Calling dir() without arguments returns the list of names that live in the current global scope.
