# 10 - Stacks and Queues

## Introduction

Like linked lists, a stack is a data structure that consists of node. However, unlike a linked list, stack nodes can only ever reference the next node in the stack - not the previous one.

There are several common terms that are used when working with stacks.

- **Push** - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- **Pop** - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **Top** - This is the top of the stack.
- **Peek** - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- **IsEmpty** - Returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

Additionally, stacks follow two similar bust distinct concepts of operation.

1. **First In Last Out** - The first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.
2. **Last In First Out** - The last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.
