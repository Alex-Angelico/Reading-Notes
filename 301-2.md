## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Despite the fact that when pair programming only one of two people necessarily can write code, two people working together in this way tend to produce higher-quality code over a shorter timeframe. This is because while it takes somewhat longer to write, pair programming teams are better at catching mistakes and refining the product as they go. Moreover, they can collaborate on problem-solving more effectively when stuck.

2. Having a teammate keeps pair programmers more focues, because there is mutual dependency on the other being engaged. This dependency also makes it easier to ask for help from one another.

3. The dynamics of it offer some of the best opportunities for peer education, simply because of how much communicaiton and mutual focus is involved on a share problem. This allows students to very effectively reinforce their own understanding with an immediate example by both teaching and learning, especially if the teammates have complementary skillsets.

4. Socializing is a natural part of pair programming, which has long-term career impacts if the programmers use the time well. Employers want to hire people who can work well in teams.

5. Additionally, pair programming is directly incorporated into many software engineer interviewing routines.

6. The practice gives one a head-start on the type of challenges and work contexts they will be exposed to once hired.

## Chapter 3 Selections of JavaScript/jQuery

jQuery doe not offer any unique capabilities that JavaScript lacks. What jQ does offer to JS programmers, however, is a form of notation that is more economical and easier to use for accomplishing things like DOM manipulation.

To use jQ on a web page, programmers need to use a content delivery network (CDN) that host the most up-to-date version of the jQ library. Alternatively, programmers can use a fallback version that is stored on their own servers.

Much as with JS and CSS files, a jQ library is accessed by a web page by referring to it in the `<head>` section--in this case, with a `<script>` element.
