## Challenges Women Face

It is an sad and shocking how deeply the annual proporiton of computer science degrees earned by women has regressed since the 1980s.

> Men were also more familiar with programming languages than women and were more likely to report having an “expert” level of programming proficiency before enrolling at Carnegie Mellon.

Is the "experience" gap really just an unearned confidence gap? How much of our economic and technological infrastructure has been built by pseudocompetent male technical workers? Whatever the case, it is surely the case that outcomes for all kinds of products and services would be better with more women entering the field.

Perhaps the biggest obstacle that needs to be cleared is the workspace culture in tech, and even before that, the meta-narrative surrounding tech as a whole. That is a sentence that will do absolutely nothing for anybody, because the problem is already well-understood. Positive change on this scale evidently requires years if not generations to implement, because it is driven by programmed behaviors that arise from deep within our fundamental social systems. On the other hand, unexpected events (like a global pandemic) may have a catalytic effect on socioeconomic change--albeit in unpredictable ways. But if nothing else, it seems likely that sustained shift to remote working within the tech industry will alleviate at least some of the workplace toxicity that women deal with.

## Observations on Tech Diversity Data

- It is interesting how the two top tech companies where people who identify as white are significantly overrepresented are legacy hardware manufacturers from an earlier period in the tech industry.
- People of color are (not surprisingly) significantly underrepresented at top tech companies with the singular exception of Amazon. Presumably this is because so much of their warehouse labor force is composed of people of color.

## Why Diversity Matters

> At Intel, CEO Brian Krzanich has said: "A fully diverse and inclusive workplace is fundamental to our ability to innovate and deliver business results." A number of leaders we’ve spoken to are motivated by this research in their efforts to build the strongest, most innovative teams.

In a would where many enormous private enterprises have ammassed for themselves abusive power over the public, one naturally begins to wonder how the relationship between business and normal human beings could be reconfigured in a way that is advantageous to normal human beingss. It is likely that increased diversity at tech companies would be an important step towards realizing this goal, because:

1. It would give businesses better institutional knowledge and reflexes for contributing to equitable social conditions for marginalized communities.

2. It is simply right that people of all backgrounds should be able to share in the opportunities that work in the tech industry affords.

Yes and no.
