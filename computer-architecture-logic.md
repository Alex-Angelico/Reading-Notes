### Audio Bit Rates

Audio quality when expressed in terms of bit rate is referring to the granularity at which a sonic waveform is sampled, where each sample point is a numerical value corresponding to the wave's height. These numerical values are digitally stored as binary, meaning that their precision is limited by the number of bits reserved for a sample point. The larger the bit rate per sample, the smaller the variances in the waveform that can be interpreted, and the more accurate the overall interpretation of the waveform. Hence, 32 bit audio is of higher quality than 8 bit audio, 64 bit is higher than 32 bit, 192 higher than 64, etc.

### Circuitry

Ultimately, all circuits are composed of electron channels which can either be on or off. This is the foundation of the binary state that all conventional computer hardware uses for input, storage, processing, and output of data. Circuits of greater complexity are composed of larger numbers of these electron channels arranged in varying patterns to allow for differentiated manipulaiton of combinations of on/off electrical signals for different computational purposes.

### Hardware & Software

The commands that are required by a CPU to instruct it how to mannipulate binary signals received by circuitry are themselves stored in binary within computer memory. A given sequence of binary CPU commands is in fact a very simple computer program. These programs are used to direct a CPU to subject binary input signals to different kinds of arithmetic processing, transfer signals to and from data storage in memory for processing or output, and more. A single high-level user input can be comprised of orders of magnitude more binary commands, which a CPU processes very quickly.
